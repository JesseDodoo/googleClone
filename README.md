# googleClone

Jesse and Michael code review

Nice homepage, a lot of inspiration from the Google website that includes 
	many useful features
Well done on the CSS styling
What happens if you want to change back from Nederlands to English (Nederlands at the 
	bottom left is hard-coded)
Could have probably done an external image for the main google image above the search bar
Nice hover effects around the search bar and buttons
favicon could have had no white background
Port could probably be 80 instead of 3000 so you can get HTTP requests from web pages (Google)
Put results in a different web page
Search function not working
Can't talk much about the EJS file because I dont know about it but I noticed 
different coloured open and closing pointy arrows (looks like an error)
Could add a way to submit form with enter button (submit instead of click)
Fetching from local host instead of google
for loop with data.length, could be hundreds of millions of results if you linked google
1 out of 3 routes work
Noticed some alt attributes were empty, so either remove them or preferably add some info
(Was it intentional so screen readers can skip the image?)
Good use of async/await, results could load at different times
Linked getSite to id number instead of something like /random. What if you want a 
	webpage with a specific number's result
